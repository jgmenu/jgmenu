NOTES ON ICONS
==============

The main loop kicks off two threads to load icons,
	- the first for the root menu;
	- the second for the rest (this one starts when the first is finished.)
This allows the root-menu to be displayed quickly whilst the rest is loaded in
the background.

When jgmenu if first run, icon 'cache' is created at '~/.cache/jgmenu/icons/'.
The cache consists of symlinks pointing to icons which match the name, size and
theme. For example: folder -> /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/22x22/places/folder.png

On subsequence runs, icon.c reads the symlinks, thus avoiding expensive
operations searching for icons.

The file index.theme contains the icon theme and size associated with the
symlinks. If either of these is changed in the jgmenu config, the cache will
be re-created on the next run.

If an icon cannot be found during the cache creation, an empty file is created
instead of the symlink.
